<h2 id="COMPANY_B">COMPANY B<br />
18th Regiment Ohio Volunteers&mdash;Three<br />
Months Troops.</h2>


<p>The company was recruited by Frank Buell, at Marietta,
Ohio, who was at the time Captain of the “Union Blues,” an
independent company of the Ohio militia. It was enrolled from
the 15th to the 22nd of April, 1861, though a few men joined as
late as May 27th, the date of our arrival at Marietta from Columbus,
on our way into Virginia. Governor Dennison accepted
Captain Buell’s tender of the company on April 17th, and our
term of service dates from that time.</p>

<p>We left Marietta on Monday morning, April 22nd. The
evening before, Sunday, the 21st, the company attended divine
service at the Congregational church, where Rev. Thomas
Wickes, D. D., the pastor of the church, delivered an earnest
patriotic sermon. To this address, R. L. Nye, Esq., a member
of the company, feelingly replied. Each member of the company
was presented with a neat pocket edition of the New Testament
by the Washington County Bible Society, through its
president, Mr. Daniel P. Bosworth, Sr. At the close of this
ceremony two of the members of the company, William Holden
and Thomas H. North, were received into the church.</p>

<p>Just before embarking on the steamer “Lizzie Martin” for
Zanesville, on the morning of the 22d, a beautiful silk flag, provided
by the women of Marietta, was presented to the company
by Melvin Clarke, Esq., in a short patriotic address, to which
Captain Buell briefly but earnestly responded, giving the company’s
pledge that the banner never would be disgraced in its
hands. Fully 3,000 people were assembled at the time on the<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
“Common” in front of the Congregational church. I give the
following description of the leave taking from the “Marietta
Intelligencer,” of May 1st, 1861.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... Then followed the leave-taking, a scene that cannot
be described. Here were fathers and mothers hanging upon
the necks of sons in a last long embrace, wives clinging to their
husbands in agonies of distress, brothers bidding adieu to brothers,
friend giving friend his farewell greeting. Scarcely a dry
eye was to be seen in the immense crowd. But the sorrow of
parting, though it caused the tears to flow abundantly, was
mitigated by the thought that children, kindred and friends&mdash;all
were responding to the call of duty, they were going to defend
the government to which we all owe our safety&mdash;our very
existence.</p>

<p>“The company was ranged on the hurricane deck, and as
the boat moved out from the landing cheer upon cheer arose
from the vast assemblage, hats were swung, handkerchiefs
waved, and many a ‘God speed you,’ uttered, and the crowd
slowly and sadly dispersed.”</p></div>

<p>On our way to Zanesville we were cheered at every landing,
and at the more important points we were received with the
most enthusiastic demonstrations. At Lowell, the home of Captain
Buell, at Beverly, Windsor, McConnelsville, Malta, all day
long cheers, addresses, salutes, and every demonstration that
the bubbling spirit of patriotism could suggest were furnished
until on our arrival at Zanesville we were fairly worn out with
the overwhelming attentions of the people.</p>

<p>A letter written after our arrival at Columbus to the “Marietta
Republican,” by Eli P. Boring, a printer who had volunteered
from the force of that paper, gives so good a description of
our journey that I gladly subjoin it in full:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ir2">“Columbus, Ohio, April 30, 1861.</p>

<p>“Col. McCormick:&mdash;After leaving Marietta we were received
with ‘loud and long applause’ at every village along the Muskingum
valley. At Lowell, (Capt. Buell’s home,) the whole
neighborhood was on the bank of the canal. At Beverly patriotism
was boiling over. The ladies on Sunday morning went to
work and made a flag 54 feet long and well proportioned in
width, and the gentlemen got a pole 60 or 75 feet long and raised<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
it within about 30 feet of the locks, and by the time we arrived
there the flag was ‘proudly floating to the breeze,’ with men,
women and children rallying around. Captain Barclay, with
about 40 men for a ‘Home Guard,’ received us with three salutes,
each man having a gun of some kind. At Windsor, Luke Chute,
McConnelsville, and in fact every place along the river the people
were out on the banks cheering for the Union and for the
volunteers. We arrived at Zanesville about 12 o’clock midnight,
and marched through several of the streets, led by our ‘Young
America Brass Band,’ who received scores of compliments for
their excellent music. We left Zanesville at 2:00 o’clock A. M.
arriving here about 6 A. M., and it was 1 P. M. before any of the
boys got their breakfast, and when they got it not one could eat, the
meat being bad and the coffee very poor, but, through the influence
of Mr. George W. Gili, we got good quarters on Thursday evening,
where we have been ever since. After breakfast we march
to Camp Jackson, and drill until 12 o’clock, then march back to
our quarters and take dinner. In the afternoon we go through
the same and return to supper. From 5 o’clock we have until
9 for our own use, and you can just bet high we make use of it.
At 9:00 the roll is called and we retire to the loft of a very large
brick barn with our blankets and each a good comforter. It is
the general opinion that we will be sent back to Marietta or to
Camp Dennison, to be kept as the reserve militia of Ohio, either
of which will be protested against by every member of our
company. We want to go where we can have something to do.
There is not a man of us who can bear the idea of lying around
a camp. If there is to be any fighting done we want a hand in
it. We parted from our friends with the expectation of being
in Washington city, or on our way to Fort Pickens or Fort
Sumpter before this time. If there is any fighting done it will
be a sore disappointment to all of us if we do not have a mix.</p>

<p class="ir2">“E. P. B.”</p></div>

<p>As friend Boring states we arrived at Columbus about 6:00
A. M. We were marched up to the State House and spent the
day about the grounds. We had a meal about 1 o’clock P. M.,
at the “Goodale House,” but so many hungry men had preceded
us that but little to eat was left and that little was of poor
quality and poorly cooked and served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Some of our boys had friends in the city and were invited
to dinner with them and thus fared sumptuously. The first
night we were quartered in the basement of the state house,
where we slept on beds of straw upholstered with small lumps
of coal. The next night we quartered in the rotunda of the
capitol building, sleeping on the marble floor with neither
straw nor coal to temper the springs of our beds. The next day
we went to “Camp Jackson,” now “Goodale Park.” Here we
spent some four weeks, drilling and learning the other duties of
soldiers. On Thursday, the 25th, we were given quarters at the
Ohio Penitentiary, taking our meals there and sleeping on the
parlor and office floors and in the loft of a large barn adjoining
the prison. Our meals during the time we were quartered here
were taken at the mess table of the officers of the prison and
were very satisfactory and a great improvement over our camp
fare. We remained here about two weeks, when we returned to
our barracks in camp. During our stay at the Penitentiary we
spent the hours between meals at the camp drilling, etc.</p>

<p>Our patience was sorely tried during this period for we
were very anxious to be assigned to a regiment and to get into
the field. Some of our members finding opportunity to get into
regiments that were going into active service sought transfers
and left us. Among these I now recall R. L. Nye and Frank
Bosworth, who entered the 17th O., J. Mills Kendrick, who found
a position in the Adjutant General’s office, at Columbus, and
“Dick” (Richard H.) Green, who recruited a company for the
25th Ohio, three year service, and became its captain. However,
we at length were assigned to the 18th O. as Co. B. Capt.
Buell was a modest man, without political “pull,” and our representative
in the legislature, Hon. John Haddow, while a patriotic,
level headed, well meaning man, was inexperienced in political
wire pulling, and was no match for the men of large experience
and great cheek, who were constantly wedging themselves
in and wedging us out. Both Mr. Haddow and Captain
Buell were blamed for these delays, but I am satisfied that they
both did the best they could. Buell was scarcely more than a
boy, being but 23 years old, and he could not be expected to
cope with men of greater experience and less conscience.</p>

<p>But at last the order came for us to “break camp” and it<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
was received with uproarious delight. We left “Camp Jackson”
on May 23rd for Loveland, where we changed cars for Athens.
We arrived there on the 24th and were mustered into the service
by Major Joshua W. Sill,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the regular army.</p>

<p>After spending a few days here in “Camp Scott,” we departed
for Marietta on the evening of the 27th. Arrived at
Marietta about 11 o’clock in the evening and marched up to
“Camp Putnam,” where we spent the night. Co. K, Captain John
Henderson, of Beverly, accompanied us to Athens, from “Camp
Jackson.”</p>

<p>At Marietta we found a number of other companies of the
regiment assembled.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th the company was formed and
marched down town to show our home people the improvement
we had made in our military education. After an exhibition of
our skill in military evolution and an hour or two spent with
our friends, we returned to camp. At this time quite a number
of recruits joined the company and were mustered in. Immediately
after dinner we received marching orders. We left camp
about 3:00 P. M. and marched down town and across the bridge
to Harmar, where in due time we boarded cars and pulled out
for Parkersburg.</p>

<p>We crossed the river at Parkersburg on the railroad ferry
boat “Webster,” and moved out to the farm of a Mr. Hutchins,
adjoining Judge Stephenson’s. We were the first to camp on
this ground, afterwards throughout the war known as “Camp
Union,” the name given it that day by Captain Buell.</p>

<p>Our tents and baggage did not arrive until about 11 o’clock
P. M. During the night a cold rain set in and some of the boys,
John T. Booth and others, got one of the tents pitched, which
was the first tent put up in “Camp Union.”</p>

<p>The other tents were pitched early in the morning and soon
things began to look more cheerful. The 14th Ohio, Col. Steedman,
from Toledo, had encamped in Parkersburg previous to
our arrival, but they occupied the railroad depot, being without
tents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>
<p>Today, the 29th, an election for field officers of the regiment
was held with the following result:</p>

<p>Colonel, Timothy R. Stanley, of Athens; Lieut. Colonel,
Capt. William Bolles, of Company C, Ironton, and for Major, our
Second Lieutenant, William H. Bisbee, of Marietta.</p>

<p>We received our first accoutrements today: knapsacks,
haversacks, canteens, caps, socks, etc.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 30th&mdash;Early this morning orders came to
“strike tents” and prepare to move. We marched down to the
railroad track and there waited until about 2:00 o’clock P. M.,
when our train arrived and we started off eastward. During our
wait Col. Stanley addressed the regiment. The people of Parkersburg
gave us a good dinner, today. We moved slowly out,
while our friends who had congregated to see us off gave us
hearty cheers and God speed. We were now in high spirits as
we were at last “in the field,” after five weeks of weary waiting,
and disappointments. Our train, however, soon stopped when
a corporal and six men were told off and left to guard the trestle
near by. This was repeated until well toward evening Capt.
Buell and his remaining 20 men were disembarked at what was
afterwards known as the “Burnt Bridge,” over Walker’s Creek,
half a mile west of Petroleum station. Co. A, Captain John McMahon,
was also left here with us. This bridge, about 60 feet
in length, had been burned by the enemy, two nights before. After
a meager supper we were taken up and stationed for the
night on the top of an abrupt eminence overlooking the bridge,
where we spent the night anxiously waiting for a prowling
enemy. Practically every man of the company was on guard.
Two prowlers came to the neighborhood of the bridge during
the night and one of Co. A fired on them, but without known
effect.</p>

<p>May 31&mdash;About dark the Captain with a detail of men made
a trip down the railroad track, about three miles, to a tunnel,
guarded by Corporal Holden and a squad of six men. He talked
with the dwellers along the line and after hearing the corporal’s
report of an attack upon him the night before, which he and his
command gallantly beat off, we returned to camp, arriving about
11 P. M.</p>

<p>After supper we camped down as best we could for the<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
night, receiving orders, however, to be ready at daylight on the
morrow to go on the march.</p>

<p>Today, (June 1), contrary to expectations, we remained in
camp all day.</p>

<p>June 2&mdash;Were called out about an hour before daylight and
started for a point called California, on the N. Western Pike, at
which place, one Clark, hotel keeper, was reported to have concealed
a large store of arms and ammunition, and where the
young men of the neighborhood were in the habit of meeting to
drill. After diligent search and finding nothing of a warlike
character we passed on to “Goose Creek.” Spent most of the
day in searching houses of the citizens suspected of disloyalty.
In one house an enraged citizen was poked out of a wheat bin
in his loft, by John T. Booth, who had put his bayonet on his
gun for the purpose of “feeling round” in the bin. He came out
of that bin with his fighting clothes on. Returning we reached
camp early in the evening. During our absence a rumor reached
camp that we were in a tight place and a part of company A
was sent out to succor us. They had a long hard march for
nothing, but, we were learning the trade of soldiering and it all
counted.</p>

<p>Last night and today, (June 3), a down pour of rain visited
us and our bridge, almost completed, is in danger of being
carried away. Wm. Scott went home on sick leave today.</p>

<p>June 4.&mdash;The rain kept up all night and our bridge was
partially swept away. A large number of soldiers detailed to
assist in getting out timber for repairing the structure. On
June 5, trains were again crossing the bridge.</p>

<p>On June 6, a “Liberty Pole” was erected at Petroleum station,
and when the flag was run up Companies A and B under
command of Captain McMahon saluted it with three rounds.</p>

<p>June 7.&mdash;Captain Buell returned from Parkersburg, where
he had been on orders, on an early train. Following this came
another on which was our scattered squads, who had been relieved.
We joined them and were soon under way
eastward. Stopping a few moments at Ellenboro to permit the
“Express” to pass, we moved on to “Toll Gate” station, where
Co. B was disembarked, and went into camp. Our duty here<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
was to guard another “burnt bridge,” near the station. Co. K,
Captain Henderson, went into camp just east of us. This evening,
our stock of soft bread having run low, and the boys not
having as yet quite fallen in love with our “cylinder heads” as
they termed our big round hard biscuit&mdash;the Captain detailed a
squad of us to take a barrel of flour on a hand car to Ellenboro,
nine miles back, and have it turned into bread. Arriving at
Ellenboro about dark we distributed the flour among a number
of the families of the village and by 9 o’clock in the evening we
had a fine supply of good bread and biscuits. We reached camp
about midnight. This was a foolhardy performance, especially
at night. The trains were not only off time but extras were
moving constantly. Between our camp and Ellenboro there was
at least one very long tunnel and it is a marvel that we were
not run down by one of these trains. The people of Ellenboro
were so kind and hospitable to us that it is safe to say none of
that squad will ever forget our novel but delightful experience
there.</p>

<p>Under this date the Marietta Republican says: “The ladies
of Marietta have furnished many articles for the comfort of the
Washington County Volunteers, now in Virginia. The Havelock
or linen shades to be worn on their caps will be appreciated this
hot weather and so will the canteens.” This “Havelock” was
well meant but on a hot day the “shade” as the editor called it
seemed to keep the air from circulating about the neck and
rather increased than allayed our discomforts, and they were
soon discarded. The writer still preserves his in his collection
of war relics.</p>

<p>“June 8.&mdash;Today we held an election for Second Lieutenant
to fill the vacancy created by the election of Lieut. Bisbee as
Major of the regiment. A number of candidates were voted for.
After the first ballot the contest narrowed down to three,
Jewett Palmer, Jr., who received a plurality on the first ballot,
Wallace W. Hill and Oscar Underwood. After the second ballot
Underwood was dropped, and on the third ballot, after a
spirited contest, Hill was elected, by a majority of five.” The
writer felt very proud of his support when he reflected that six
weeks before he had not known half a dozen men in the company.
Hill was a fine soldier, and distinguished himself later<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
in the war as commander of his battery, “C,” 1st W. Va., Light
Artillery.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 9.&mdash;Quietly in camp.</p>

<p>On June 10, about 11 o’clock P. M., Capt. Buell with about
50 men of his company and a like number from Co. K, under
Capt. Henderson, set out for a point some ten miles distant,
where it was reported a native had a quantity of arms and
equipments stored. The force reached and surrounded the place
about daylight&mdash;stirred out the garrison&mdash;one man, a not overly
bright woman, an idiotic child and a rifle, with an old broken
flint lock. By careful maneuvering the command succeeded in
reaching camp about 11 o’clock A. M., without the loss of a man.</p>

<p>On June 11th, Col. H. B. Canington, Adjutant General of Ohio,
and Col. T. R. Stanley, accompanied by the “McArthur Cornet
Band,” our regimental band, paid us a brief visit and passed on
to Parkersburg.</p>

<p>On June 12.&mdash;Col. Stanley called at the camp of Company
K, on his way east and made the boys a brief address. During
the day we had a visit from Hon. Geo. P. Buell, of the “Cincinnati
Times,” a brother of Captain Frank’s, Dr. Hall, of Harrisville,
Va., and Ed. C. Skinnard, clerk in the Marietta P. O. The
latter brought a quantity of mail for us from the folks at home.</p>

<p>On June 13 our first blouses were received and while they
were being distributed a train “whistled in” and the order was
given to strike tents and load up. We were soon under way
and arrived at Clarksburg about noon. After an hour’s wait we
moved on to Bridgeport, about 6 miles beyond. Here we left
the cars and marched out about a mile north of the village to
the Sandusky farm, where we went into what proved to be the
pleasantest camp of our three months’ experience. Situated on
a gentle elevation covered with a solid turf, with plenty of
shade and good water near at hand, we here enjoyed our soldier
life to the utmost. Company A rejoined us here and the camp
was under the command of Captain McMahon. We remained
here four weeks, until July 13th, drilling, guarding railroad
bridges and tunnels, taking in an occasional “secesh” prowler
and making ourselves generally useful. The next day after our
arrival some generous hearted neighbor came into camp with
a wagon load of bread, butter, milk and other edibles, a free offering<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
which we greatly enjoyed. During our stay here the people
of Bridgeport and the surrounding country placed us under
constant obligations for like generous treatment. The remembrance
of this kindness is fresh in the minds of all the survivors
of the two companies.</p>

<p>On the 18th, our Major, W. H. Bisbee, visited the camp and
the boys, especially of Co. B, gave him a warm greeting.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, Sergt. T. G. Field, Corporals Holden and
Haskins, and privates Palmer, Pixley, Stanley, Vickers and
drummer <a id="Ref_12"></a>Fougeres, went home on furlough for a few days.</p>

<p>On this day also our Drum Major, Ebenezer Corey, returned
to camp from Marietta with ten recruits for the band: George
Jenvey, William Jenvey, Charles Holden, H. M. Langley, John
Tenney, James Judd, Henry Corey, Frank Brenan, Fred Regnier
and Wm. H. Smith.</p>

<p>While in camp here privates William Holden and Charles
P. Wilson were detailed at the request of Lieut. John C. Paxton,
our Regimental Quartermaster, for clerks in his office at
Clarksburg, where the headquarters of the regiment were located.</p>


<h3>JULY 4.</h3>

<p>For some days the people of the vicinity and the men in
camp had been preparing for a celebration of the day and by
8:00 o’clock in the morning the people began to arrive with
wagons loaded with bread and butter, cakes, pies, roast chicken,
roast pigs and dainties innumerable. Our camp had been thoroughly
policed and put in prime order, and the camp guard had
strict orders for the night before not to permit any one to pass
out and no passes were given. This was to prevent any of
the boys from visiting an “Apple Jack” distillery located not
far from camp. The Captains were to put their best foot forward
in their part of the day’s displays and did not want the
“spirits” mixed, when the time for parade came. A number of
long tables had been erected in the shade of the trees near
camp and these were early covered with the superabundant supplies.
Scores of young ladies came with the crowds and they
were the waiters at the dinner. By 9:00 o’clock the crowd on
the ground numbered fully one thousand. At 10 A. M. came
the drill, followed by a dress parade. The exhibition embraced<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
manual of arms, company evolutions, volley firing, etc., to the
great enjoyment of the people.</p>

<p>The boys felt proud of their part of the day’s doings and
were complimented highly for their efficiency. After the military
show was over violins were brought out and soon soldiers
and citizens, the young ladies especially, were joined in the dance
on the green sward under the branches of the great oaks.
Games of many kinds were indulged in&mdash;swings were put up
and liberally patronized by the youngsters, and all hands enjoyed
themselves in various ways until the dinner hour. At 12:30
dinner was announced, when the companies fired “three rounds”
as the closing act of the forenoon’s programme. Just at this
time a train load of enthusiastic soldiers and citizens arrived
from Grafton and other points east of us and Co. B formed and
marched over to Bridgeport and escorted them to camp. The
dinner was a great success. Five times the tables were filled
and cleared of food and guests. No one was neglected or turned
away hungry. After dinner a member of Co. A delivered a well
prepared address in an impressive manner. He was followed
by Capt. Buell in a brief and spirited address, and he by an
elderly minister of the locality, whose name has escaped me.
Songs, sentimental, military and comic, fife and drum and violin
music were interspersed and a most enjoyable day all too rapidly
drew to a close.</p>

<p>From July 5th to the 13th, the routine of camp duties went
on as before, but on that day marching orders were received.
By 5:00 o’clock P. M., tents were struck and taken to the station,
except a few left to shelter the men detailed to guard camp
in our absence. We soon were under way eastward.</p>

<p>Our train now held the full regiment, the first time we had
come together as such since leaving Parkersburg, May 29th. We
arrived at Oakland on the morning of the 14th, and lay in camp
until the afternoon of the 15th, when, Whitelaw Reid says,
“About 5:00 o’clock P. M., Gen. Hill moved with the 5th and
18th Ohio regiments from Oakland in a diagonal line to the
bridge on the Northwestern Pike, over the west branch of the
Potomac, at which point he was to be joined by Col. Irvine’s
command from Red House, intending to turn the enemy’s right
and cut them off before they could reach Petersburg. Here, at<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
the bridge a dispatch was received from McClellan informing
Hill of the action at Carrick’s Ford and the death of Garnett.”</p>

<p>We “marched over the Allegheny mountains, a distance of
<span class="nowrap">35 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> miles in 24 hours, after leaving Oakland. At 4:00 o’clock
the next morning (17th) Gen. Hill, with about 800 picked men
in light marching order started for an additional forced march
but after moving five miles was overtaken by a courier with a
dispatch from McClellan ordering him to return.”</p>

<p>We returned leisurely to Oakland and there went into
camp, remaining until the morning of the 23rd of July, when
the regiment took cars for the west. We reached Bridgeport
about the middle of the afternoon and after getting our camp
guards and equipage aboard moved slowly on to Clarksburg.
Here we went into camp until the 30th when we again took
cars for Parkersburg and home! While in camp at Clarksburg
a call was made for volunteers to go to Rosecrans, on Gauley,
where he was about to engage in battle with Gen. Floyd’s forces.</p>

<p>The regiment was drawn up in line and a call made upon
those who were willing to go to step out five paces to the front.
Not a score of men left their places in the ranks. Our time had
expired on the 17th, and many of the men had already made
arrangements to enter the three years’ service in other organizations
and were anxious to get home and take up the new work.</p>

<p>We jogged along nearly all night, 30th-31st, side-tracking for
eastbound trains, nearly all of which carried troops. As we
were nearing Parkersburg early in the day of the 31st a man
belonging to Co. I, fell from the top of a car and was mortally
hurt, dying a day or two later. At Parkersburg we took the railroad
ferry steamer, “Daniel Webster,” for Marietta, the same
boat that brought us to Parkersburg in May. We arrived off
Harmar about 2:00 o’clock P. M. The banks on both sides of
the Ohio and Muskingum rivers were lined with our friends, who
had assembled to bid us welcome.</p>

<p>The “Putnam Light Artillery,” of Marietta, boomed forth
a loud-mouthed welcome. The boat rounded to near the
“Point.” Here we disembarked and after a warm greeting by
our friends, fell in and marched through the city to “Camp Putnam.”
The whole population seemed to be out and our march
was a continuous ovation. Before “Camp Putnam” was reached<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
Co. B was reduced to a platoon. Many of the town boys quietly
slipped out of ranks and accompanied their friends home. About
the middle of the following forenoon the regiment was drawn
up in line in Camp Putnam, when Col. Stanley gave us a few
final words of farewell, and we were dismissed until such time
as we should be called together for final muster-out and pay.
On August 30th, the following call appeared in the Marietta
papers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center sansseriffont boldfont">“ATTENTION COMPANIES B AND K!</p>

<p>“Companies B and K, 18th Regiment, O. V. M., will be paid

<h3>“PONY SECTION”</h3>

<p>The ten recruits brought to the regiment June 18, by Major
Corey, were nearly all boys, whom some one very aptly dubbed
“The Pony Section.” Our company being entitled to but two
musicians, and having our complement already, these boys were
assigned to the other companies of the regiment and were borne
upon their rolls, but as the Drum Corps remained with Co. B
nearly all the term of our service they were treated as Co. B boys
and I append to that of the regular roll of the company their after
service.</p>

<p>BRENAN, FRANK R.&mdash;Bugler, Battery C, 1st W. Va. Light
Artillery. Mustered out with battery. Marietta, O.</p>

<p>COREY, HENRY.&mdash;Musician, (drummer), Co. G, 36th O. Infantry.

<p>JENVEY, GEORGE K.&mdash;Bugler, Co. F, 2nd W. Va. Cavalry,
November 19, 1861. Re-enlisted, January 1, 1864. Mustered out
with regiment. Veteran. Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>JUDD, JAMES G.&mdash;Musician, (drummer), Co. I, 36th O. Infantry,
Aug. 12, 1861. Mustered out with regiment July 27, 1865.
Veteran. Marietta, O.</p>

<p>* LANGLEY, HENRY M.&mdash;Enlisted in Battery C, 1st W. Va.
Light Artillery at its organization. Appointed 2nd Lieut., Oct. 16,
1862. Resigned April 22, 1863.</p>

<p>* REGNIER, FREDERICK.&mdash;Private Battery H, 1st O. Light
Artillery, Oct. 17, 1861. Mustered out Nov. 17, 1864, at expiration
of term of service.</p>

<p>ROBERTS, JAMES D.</p>

<p>* SMITH, WM. H.&mdash;In gunboat service on western rivers.</p>

<p>TENNEY, JOHN.&mdash;Musician, (fifer) Co. E, 36th O. Infantry,
Aug. 31, 1861. Appointed Principal Musician, Sept. 10, 1864. Mustered
out with regiment. Veteran. Broken Arrow, Okla.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the expiration of our term of enlistment nearly all the
members of the company re-entered the service. I have found but
nine who are known not to have re-entered the army, and most
of these did more or less militia duty from time to time during
the war. Those reentering the service were distributed as
follows:</p>

<div id="Ref_23" class="center">

<p>Of the members of the “Pony Section,” 3 went into “Buell’s
Battery,” 3 into the 36th O. Infantry, 1 into the 2nd W. Va. Cavalry,
1 into Battery H, 1st O. Lt. Artillery and 1 into the Gunboat
service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>Of those who re-entered the service 21 became commissioned
officers and almost all the others became non-commissioned officers.
I have accounted for 75 of the company, leaving 24 unaccounted
for. The names of these stand on the roll with no explanatory
remarks appended.</p>

<p>Those known to have died number 56; those known to be living,
19; unascertained, 24.</p>

<p>The formal muster out of the regiment dates August 28, 1861.
The muster in of Co. B dates April 17, 1861, making the term served
by the company 4 months and 11 days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In closing this sketch I want to return my hearty thanks to
Dr. John T. Booth, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for the kind loan of his invaluable
diary of “Three months with the 18th Ohio Infantry 3
months troops.” By its help I have been enabled to fix dates and
locations for which I had no other resource. I have drawn largely
too from his narrative, at times using his very language, for which
I had his generous warrant. He was a member of the company
and afterwards spent three years in the service with the 36th O.
Infantry. He is the historian of that regiment, his unpublished
history of which is an inexhaustive mine of information.</p>

<span class="largefont sansseriffont">COL. CLARKE&mdash;CAPT. BUELL.</span></h2>


<p>A strange coincidence is that of the similar deaths of Colonel
Clarke and Captain Buell. Within 18 months from the morning
upon which Col. Clarke presented to our company the beautiful
flag mentioned as the gift of the women of Marietta and its acceptance
by Captain Buell, both had fallen in battle, Col. Clarke
leading his regiment, the 36th O. Infantry, at Antietam, Maryland,
and Captain Buell commanding his battery, C, 1st W. Va. Light
Artillery, at Freeman’s Ford, Virginia.</p>

<p>(From the “Marietta Intelligencer” of May 1, 1861.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The following is a part of a communication from one who
occasionally contributes to our columns. It is a worthy tribute to
the stranger volunteer.</p>

<p>“... But I cannot close without paying a passing tribute to
the noble heroism of one of the volunteers who left us, today. I<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
saw in the ranks a young German who evidently was a stranger
here. I was told that he was simply on a visit to this country,
but seeing the hour of peril upon us he boldly stepped into the
ranks of those brave and true hearts who have just left us. As
they moved down to the boat and friends were taking a final parting,
he burst into tears, saying: ‘I have no friends here to bid
me good bye.’ I need not say how a chord was struck by those
simple words which went to every heart; his hands were grasped
with a fervor which told that such noble self-sacrifice claimed the
homage of every true heart.”</p></div>

<p>John T. Booth, in his diary under date of June 19th, in camp
near Bridgeport, Va., notes: “I received a letter today from Miss
Mary J. Krewson, of Birmingham, opposite Pittsburg, Pa. (the
lady who at the close of the war became my wife.) We were
playmates when about three years of age.” (Note&mdash;Dr. Booth and
his good wife are both living and enjoying the comforts of an
ideal home at No. 3646 Central avenue, Cincinnati, O.)</p>

<h2 id="OUR_CAMPS" class="sansseriffont">OUR CAMPS.</h2>


<p>Our first, at Columbus, was “Camp Jackson,” now beautiful
Goodale Park. At Athens, where we spent but a few days, our
camp was by some called “Camp Jewett,” but I remember it as
“Camp Scott.” At Marietta, “Camp Putnam.” At Parkersburg,
“Camp Union,” so christened by Captain Buell. At the first
“burnt bridge,” near Petroleum Station, on the B. &amp; O. railroad,
our camp took the name of “Camp Whip po’will” from the nocturnal
and lugubrious serenades furnished us by this strange bird. Our
next camp near Toll Gate Station, being located in an old pasture
field, covered with briars, was dubbed “Camp Briar Patch,” by
Manly Warren, a name that stuck.</p>

<p>We next went into camp near Bridgeport on the beautiful
farm of a Mr. Sandusky and for him we named our camp “Sandusky.”
We remained at Oakland but a few days and I think no
name was given this uncomfortable camping place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following resolution, with others, was adopted by the
boys while we were quartered at the Ohio Penitentiary:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Resolved, that this company owes a debt of gratitude to G.
W. Gill, and to John A. Prentice, Warden of the Ohio Penitentiary,
for relieving this company from the subterranean vaults of the
State Capitol and furnishing them with comfortable quarters due
to civilized and intelligent citizen soldiers....</p>

<p>The following from the “Marietta Republican” of May 24,
notes the one loss by death that came to us during our whole
term of service.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“George W. Ridgeway, one of the Marietta Volunteers, was
taken sick at Columbus and discharged. A short time after he
got home he died, and was buried at Rainbow, last Sunday (19th)
with the honors of war by the Union Blues and the Defiance Infantry
Company.”</p></div>

<h2 id="CAPTAIN_BUELL" class="sansseriffont">CAPTAIN BUELL.</h2>


<p>I have made no effort to prepare a biography of Captain Buell,
the sketch is itself in a way a biography. He is the central figure
of my little history and aside from his work with the Pierpoint
Battery it gives a full history of his service.</p>

<p>He was born at Lowell, Washington county, Ohio, April 24,
1837, and was the youngest son of Perez B. and Elizabeth
(Rector) Buell. His 23rd birthday he spent in “Camp Jackson,”
at Columbus, two days after leaving Marietta with his company.
He had chosen the profession of the law and was Prosecuting Attorney
of Washington county when the war broke out. He was
killed in battle at Freeman’s Ford, Fauquier county, Virginia,
August 22, 1862.</p>

<p>At the time of his death he had been selected for a higher
command and had he lived a few days longer would have received
substantial promotion in the artillery arm of the service. His
distinguished bearing had attracted the attention of such soldiers
as Generals Siegel and Milroy, the Chief of Artillery of the 11th
Corps and others.</p>

<p>His remains were buried at Bealton Station and in the following
December were removed to the family burying ground located
on the old home farm, at Lowell. His comrades of Battery<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
C erected a handsome monument at his grave soon after the close
of the war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the preparation of the foregoing pages I have been actuated
by a desire to place in convenient and permanent form the
simple facts connected with the company’s modest service. We
were not only the first from Washington county to respond to
the president’s call for volunteers but were the first from all
southeastern Ohio. Only 9 of the 220 companies of three
months’ volunteers, accepted by the government antedated our
enrollment (these were dated the 16th) and but 17 others bore
even date with us.</p>

<p>I have attempted simply to state facts in as plain a way as
possible that may be of value so far as they go to the future
searcher in this pioneer service of the war. The work has taken
considerable time and labor but it has been one of pleasure and
I shall be more than repaid if it meets with the approval of my
surviving comrades and the friends of Captain Buell and his
pioneer company of patriotic volunteers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
